# datasets_dft_accuracy
Data repository for the paper "How Accurate Are DFT Forces? Unexpectedly Large Uncertainties in Molecular Datasets"

The repository contains the forces (provided in .xyz files) recomputed with different ORCA for the 1000 configuration random samples of the ANI-1x, Transition1x, AIMNet2, and SPICE datasets. Original reported forces are labelled with the "REF_forces" keyword, recomputed forces with "orca_forces"
