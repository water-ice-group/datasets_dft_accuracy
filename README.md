Data repository for the paper "How Accurate Are DFT Forces? Unexpectedly Large Uncertainties in Molecular Datasets"

The repository contains files of net forces (.npy) in the datasets investigated. It also contains the forces (provided in .xyz files) recomputed with different ORCA and Psi4 settings for the 1000 configuration random samples of the ANI-1x, Transition1x, AIMNet2, and SPICE datasets.
